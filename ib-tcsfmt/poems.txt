You have come to me from a distant land,
Dreamer of dreams, to fill my hearts desire,
Sweet music flowing from your nimble hand
That plays within ... to light my passion's fire.

A symphony of word and thought you bring.
Excitement builds upon crescendo's sound,
Brought forth in tones to make my light heart sing
For all the beauty that, with you, I've found.

A life is changed in just an instant's time,
All darkness fled before that brillaint sun
That shines from spoken words of softest rhyme
And speaks of treasures, only just begun.

This mystic meeting gives my heart a glow
That few have seen and only you will know.

I wish I could describe you
You're nothing but a dream
Leaving me nothing to hold onto
I feel like I could scream

I would sleep forever
Just to dream you again
Oh, can't you come to me
To free me of this pain?

I'm lying on my bed again
Waiting to fall asleep
To spend another night with you
To explore this ocean deep

I'm back in our world, I'm happy again
I see you there, and you whisk me away
And then like a bird, the time flies by
The morning arrives, much to my dismay

I cry out loud as you fade away
Begging desperately for the night to stay
My eyes open, and I close them again
Hoping to see your face for once, but nay

Again, left with nothing but the thought
That if I were to die and go to the heaven
I'd beg to live a night with you instead
After that, I'd never think of you in vain

If only I could see your face for once
If only I could feel your touch
I'd tell you how much I love you
Is that really asking for too much?


Forever takes me by a minute,
While I’m here with you.
I’m falling even more in love,
With everything you do.

Hold me in your arms,
Look deep into my eyes,
Don’t turn away and let me go,
Don’t ever tell me lies.

I swear I’ll never lose you,
In my arms I’ll always hold.
I’ll never let you slip away,
And leave nothing left untold.

There aren’t enough hours,
In each passing day,
To find all the words,
I wish I could say.

Your kiss will last forever,
Your touch forever warm.
You’ll guide me to the sunlight,
And shield me from the storm.

This is what I’m saying,
With everything that’s true,
I swear on my life,
That I really do love you.

At last, when all the summer shine
That warmed life's early hours is past,
Your loving fingers seek for mine
And hold them close at last at last!
Not oft the robin comes to build
Its nest upon the leafless bough
By autumn robbed, by winter chilled,
But you, dear heart, you love me now.

Though there are shadows on my brow
And furrows on my cheek, in truth,
The marks where Time's remorseless plough
Broke up the blooming sward of Youth,
Though fled is every girlish grace
Might win or hold a lover's vow,
Despite my sad and faded face,
And darkened heart, you love me now!

I count no more my wasted tears;
They left no echo of their fall;
I mourn no more my lonesome years;
This blessed hour atones for all.
I fear not all that Time or Fate
May bring to burden heart or brow,
Strong in the love that came so late,
Our souls shall keep it always now! 

As into your eyes I longingly gaze,
Like looking into the stars above,
Such dazzling beauty does ever amaze,
The stars, they dance, cause I'm in love.

As onto your sweet lips I gently kiss thee,
Tasting a fruit that seems forbidden,
You unleash bonds that set me free,
Awaken emotions that long were hidden.

And as into your bosom I find rest,
A sanctuary for my tumultuous soul,
I certainly count myself among the blessed,
To have found the one that makes me whole.

And throughout this universe I dare to say,
There is not another that could my heart so sway. 

Open your ears
As your eyes let down their tears
Upon hearing my song for you,
A song of a love that is so true.

This is my love song.
It's not that long,
But it does portray
The feelings that I cannot say.

So, to you, I will sing
Of the love that will always ring
In my heart, my dove.

Listen as I sing this song of love,
A song to describe you
And all that you do.

My ears will ring
And my heart will sing
At the thought of seeing you.
I only wish you'd love me too.

And now I must go,
I will see you again, my wonderful doe.
My time is nigh,
I love you, and good-bye.

I could look at your face forever
I could hold your hand for all time.
If I could have one granted wish,
it would be that you are mine.

I dream about you all the time
and they way you look at me.
I love hearing you whisper "goodnight"
I love you so much, can't you see?

That I'm crazy for your smile,
and your beautiful glossy eyes.
And when you hang with me 
you don't need to find a disguise.

You're real around me and I love it.
I love everything you do.
I can't bare to be separated,
so I'll stick to you like glue.

I could look at your face forever
I could hold you in my heart for all time.
So there's only one question left for you to answer,
will you please be mine?

Our love is that of a red rose
Whose splendor rises as the sun shows its face,
Whose petals expand further and richer
Whispering secrets of happiness and affection.

And even though with the fall of dusk
All contentment is swept away,
And the rose's petals unite as one
Reflecting any light that may endeavor to shine through,
The sun will always rise
And the rose's petals will eternally broaden
Until they fully blossom into a stunning creation.

Our love is that of a red rose
Possessing a few imperfections
That may cause evanescent wounds,
But the internal radiance
That will everlastingly bestow healing and comfort.

The sun glistens on the water
Making it sparkle and shine
It almost seems alive to me
This touches my heart

I hear a loon cry
All alone in the night
Her song haunts me
This touches my heart

I see a rose growing in a bed of sand
Struggling to survive
It seems to cry out for help to me
This touches my heart

I hold a new born baby in my arms
Opening it's eyes to a strange new world
It's crying for it's mother
This touches my heart.

All of these things touch my heart
But none near as much
As when I see you smile 

Let me lie in your arms tonight
So you can love me for the rest of our lives
Let you brighten the way with your eyes
And keep this love we share alive.

Let me feel the tenderness of you heart
With the hope that we will never be apart
Baby, it was magical from the start
Cuz we are this painting of art.

This is for you
All my emotion inside
Love that will never die.
This is for you
Can't put it in words
You are my world
This is for you.

Let me see how much you care
The love with me you want to share
Splitting with you I cannot bare
Taking that road I will not dare.

Let me know what I mean to you
Cuz I believe that our love is true
Hope that you feel the same way to
And loving you is all I want to do.

Just give me your heart
And I'll hold it tight
All of your love
I'll make it all right.

When Tomorrow starts without me
And I'm not here to see
If the sun should rise and find you eyes
All filled with tears for me

I wish so much you wouldn't cry
The way you did today
WHile thinking of the many things
We didnt get to say

I know how  much you love me
As much as I love you
And each time that you think of me
I know you'll miss me too

But when tomorrow starts without me
Please try to understand 
That an angel came and called my name
And took me by the hand

And said my place was ready In heaven far above
And that I'd have to leave behind
All those I dearly love
But when I walked through heaven's gates

I felt so much at home When
God looked down and smiled at me
From his great golden throne He said
"This is eternity and all I've promised you"

Today for life on earth is past
But here it starts a new
I promise no tomorrow
For today will always last

And since each day's the same way
There's no longing for the past
So when tomorrow starts without me
Don't think we're far apart

For every time you think of me
I'm right here in your heart
